About
======

Hello! My name is **Renqing Luo**, I hold a **BS Physics** from the UW-seattle, and I am currently pursuing a **MS Mathematics** at NYU. 

I am presently engaged in research at the [**NYU VideoLab**](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/) under the guidance of [**Professor Yao Wang**](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) and **Postdoctoral Researcher [Nikola Janjušević](https://nikopj.github.io/)**. My primary research focuses on constructing interpretable deep-learning models for 3D MRI reconstruction problems.

I am passionate about exploring, discovering, and solving complex problems. My journey from physics to applied mathematics and machine learning has been driven by a desire to apply theoretical insights to practical challenges in computer science and artificial intelligence. I thrive in environments that encourage innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration, and I am eager to contribute to advancements in AI technologies through my research and projects.
