About
======

Hello! My name is **Renqing Luo**, I hold a **Bachelor of Physics** from the University of Washington, and I am currently pursuing a **Master of Mathematics** at New York University. 

In September 2024, I joined the **NYU VideoLab** under the guidance of **Professor Yao Wang** and **Postdoctoral Researcher Nikola Janjušević**. My primary research focuses on constructing interpretable deep-learning models for 3D MRI reconstruction problems.

I am passionate about exploring, discovering, and solving complex problems. My journey from physics to applied mathematics and machine learning has been driven by a desire to apply theoretical insights to practical challenges in computer science and artificial intelligence. I thrive in environments that encourage innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration, and I am eager to contribute to advancements in AI technologies through my research and projects.
