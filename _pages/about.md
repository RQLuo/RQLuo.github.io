About
======

Hello! My name is **Renqing Luo**, I hold a **BS Physics** from the UW-seattle, and I am currently pursuing a **MS Mathematics** at NYU. 

I am privileged and grateful to conduct research at the [**NYU VideoLab**](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/) under the guidance of [**Professor Yao Wang**](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) and Postdoctoral Researcher **[Nikola Janjušević](https://nikopj.github.io/)**. My primary research focuses on constructing interpretable deep-learning models for 3D MRI reconstruction problems.
